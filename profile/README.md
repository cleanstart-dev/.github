# CleanStart
## Secure by Design. Built for Speed. Hardened Container Images. 

CleanStart is dedicated to reshaping the landscape of software supply chain security. With seamless integration, combined with continuous monitoring and vulnerability intelligence, CleanStart provides a platform that secures every step from development to delivery.

Our main goal is to make security easy for users while taking on the hard work of finding and fixing security issues. Here's how we do it:

Developer Harmony: We try to make security fit seamlessly into developers' work so they can keep moving fast without sacrificing safety.

Security Empowerment: With our tools, security teams can set up strong security rules and make sure they're followed, keeping the whole supply chain safe.

We are committed to enabling faster detection and response to threats, increasing trust, and empowering organizations to develop software with confidence by minimizing developer disruption and empowering security teams.
